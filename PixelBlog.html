Hey everyone,

It's with a heavy heart that I write this message to let you all know that I have decided to retire from my role as the Pixelfusion GFX Designer at PixelFusion. This decision has not been an easy one, but I believe it's the right time for me to step back and pursue other endeavors.

I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to all of you for your incredible support and for making my time at BloxWatch truly unforgettable. Working with all of you and creating amazing GFX designs for the community has been an absolute pleasure, and I am proud of what we have accomplished together.

I will always cherish the memories we've made, the friendships we've formed, and the art we've created. Thank you all for being a part of this incredible journey.

Though I may be retiring from my role as the Pixelfusion GFX Designer, I will never truly be gone from this community. I'll still be around, cheering you all on and supporting the amazing work that continues to be done here.

Thank you once again for everything. It's been an honor to be a part of PixelFusion, and I will always hold a special place in my heart for all of you.

With sincere gratitude,
-BloxWatch</p>
